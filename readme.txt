Something resembling the earliest stages of a game engine. Uses https://github.com/wareya/gammakit

# TODO

- tagless globals (allcaps only) (gammakit)
- shader control functions
- surface drawing, sampling from multiple textures in a single shader, etc
- built in collision system (circles, n-gons. functions return a list of all possible results)
- pack/unpack pseudo-json from strings (gammakit?)
- simple sample-and-emitter audio system, no busses, mixer channels are tags
- faucnet style networking api
- load or write strings or byte arrays to files
-- networking style buffer access with byte arrays?
- text with internal formatting
- interact with native DLLs...?
- fun stuff like font size control, drawing with transforms, colors, etc etc etc... it is all endless
